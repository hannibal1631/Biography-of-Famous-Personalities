          <h2>Life of Netaji</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Subhas Chandra Bose</b>, widely known as <b>Netaji</b>, emerged
            as a towering figure in India's fight for independence during the
            early to mid-20th century. Born on January 23, 1897, he rose through
            the ranks of the Indian National Congress but eventually parted ways
            due to ideological differences, forming the Forward Bloc to advocate
            for a more militant approach to liberation. During World War II,
            Bose sought support from Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan to
            overthrow British rule, leading to the establishment of the Indian
            National Army (INA). Despite initial successes, including the INA's
            military campaign alongside Japanese forces in Southeast Asia, the
            tide turned against the Axis powers, culminating in Bose's
            mysterious death in a plane crash in August 1945. Nevertheless, his
            legacy as a passionate nationalist and charismatic leader, who
            inspired millions to fight for freedom, remains indelible in India's
            history, making Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose an enduring symbol of the
            nation's struggle for independence.
